Intro (Jeff): 

Hello, My name is Jeffrey Phelps, representing team, "Code Rocks!" Consisting of myself, Karen Gertenback, Maria Kuznetsova,
and Eric Goldstein. Together we comprize the group that created this fun and practical entertainment application, entitled, 
"Code Rocks! (the) Super Band Locator" ...Partially inspired by a classroom example and, of course, the love of music!

In this presentation we each plan to outline what we did for our portion of the project, our successes, if you will, in 
addition to what we found challenging, and finally our individual and collective ideas on how this application can be 
expaned in the future.

Now, because my overall layout design was ultimately the one chosen, I was also chosen to begin our presentation, in addition to
being the first to talk about my portion of the project.

To us it seems pretty intuitive, upon first glance, as to what the application is intended to provide. The title clearly defines
what's going on here, and when you look at the main interface, one can see that it's music-related. You can also see that there's 
a map, a list of events, and at the bottome, here, you've got another list, but of videos.

WHAT I DID:

For my portion of the project, as I already mentioned, my overall layout was the one choosen by the group, which consists of HTML5, 
CSS3, and Bootstrap. And for the alternate library required, I added "Font-Awesome" and used it for the clever icons located here 
(for the main search panel), here (for the location panel), here (for the videos panel), and here in the footer (for the copyright 
symbol) to round out the use of that library. I also implimented a couple google fonts, for the title and body fonts.

SUCCESSUS:

Overall, we have, not one, not two, but three APIs currently powering the application, but I added the video-related API, which 
loads here at the bottom. Now, our instructor and, at least, one of the TAs, suggested to NOT use the YouTube API, as we were going 
over the project requirements in class, because it was likely "too challenging and messy," they said. So, I took that as a personal 
challenge and added this Google/Youtube video list API, which didn't turn out to be any more difficult as any of the the other 
APIs out there. So, let that be a lesson to everyone else here, to NOT necessarily listen to your instructor and/or teacher's 
assistants and just go for it, when you get great coding ideas.

CHALLENGES

What I found to be the most challenging along the way was making sure each of the three API call functions that comprise the videos 
portion the app to link the same artist originally searched for when clicking the next page and previous page buttons at the bottom
of the videos list, in addition to having the proper videos load that correspond to the "initialArtists" array and random initial artist 
function that I wrote, so that the videos match the initial random artist that loads when the page does.

EXPANDIBILITY

And finally, for the expandibility of this app, I'd persoanlly like to potentially see, perhaps, a TicketMaster API added, as well,
so that anyone using the app could purchase tickets to any one of the events listed, likely here, next to the events. (or,
a Live Stream API, of some sort, that plugs in live streaming events of concerts that may be happening at the time.)

And now, I'll hand it off to my colleague, Eric Goldstein, to continue with her portion of the project. Thanks very much!
