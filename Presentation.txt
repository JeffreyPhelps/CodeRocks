Hello, My name is Jeffrey Phelps, representing team Code Rocks! Consisting of myself, Karen Gertenback, Maria Kuznetsova,
and Eric Goldstein. Together we comprize the group that worked together to create this fun and practical entertainment 
application, entitled, "Code Rocks! Super Band Locator" ...Partially inspired by a classroom example and, of course, 
the love of music!

To us it seems pretty intuitive as to what the application is intended to provide, upon first glance.


What we did.

Successes.

Challenges.

Expandibility.
